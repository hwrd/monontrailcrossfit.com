        <h2>Foundations Course</h2>

        <p>Monon Trail CrossFit Foundations will prepare you to reach your highest possible level of fitness. Our primary goal in these classes is to introduce you to some brand new skills and movements. This is a challenging, but rewarding step. Once you have the hang of it, you'll be ready to enter our group CrossFit classes.</p>

        <h3>How Foundations works</h3>

        <p>Monon Trail CrossFit Foundations course consists of 12 group sessions that will deliver a comprehensive understanding of the movements CrossFit utilizes and will also touch on nutrition, mobility, running technique, weight lifting, gymnastic skills, and metabolic conditioning. Throughout the course, a progressive introduction to the volume and intensity levels that are inherent in our group classes will be taught. At the conclusion of the course, participants will have a solid understanding of safe and efficient movement patterns and will be ready to join our group CrossFit classes.</p>

        <p>This course meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 7:30 pm over a one month period (12 classes). The first two weeks are free then it is $147 for the next month of training (two more weeks of the Foundations Course and two weeks of regular CrossFit classes). That is a total of six weeks of training for $147 (less than you'll spend on two personal training sessions at a large commercial gym). If you sign up before the first Monday class you get all six weeks of training for $110! We start a new group at the beginning of each month.</p>
